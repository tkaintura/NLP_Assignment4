Welcome to Assignment 4 of Natural Language Processing!

We'll be using PyTorch for this assignment. If you're not familiar with PyTorch, or if you would like to review some of the fundamentals of PyTorch, there is a review notebook linked in the assignment. The Thursday TA sessions on May 11 will also go through this and answer questions. 


To create a working environment for this assignment, please run:

# 1. Create an environment with dependencies specified in local_env.yml (note that this can take some time depending on your laptop):
    
    conda env create -f local_env.yml

# 2. Activate the new environment:
    
    conda activate nlp_a4
    

# To deactivate an active environment, use
    
    conda deactivate
